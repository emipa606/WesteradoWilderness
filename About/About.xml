[b]THIS MOD REQUIRES [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1613533435]WESTERADO[/url] TO WORK![/b]
Westerado Wilderness aims to alter biomes to achieve a more western-themed feel to the game, whilst trying to maintain the balance of vanilla Rimworld.

[h1]Features[/h1]
Makes alteration to biomes to give the game more of a western theme
10+ New plants; chanterelles, prickly pears, and lavender are a select few of the new plants you'll see 
1 New weather; blizzards!
Arid biomes have more arid vegetation, adding to the feel of a desolate, hostile, place; debris-like plants and cacti now rule the arid biomes
Boreal, Forest, and Swamp biomes have a much higher degree of plant and animal life, including mushrooms
Some vanilla plants now have flowering versions of them
Compatibility and minor fixes with/to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1322101066]Snowy Trees by Nandonalt and Tejko[/url]
Arid and Cold biomes are now more hostile to settlement!

We're also planning on releasing future content updates!
